# Terminology

**Tensor:** A Tensor is a N-dimensional Matrix

**Perceptron:**

- A Perceptron is an Artificial Neuron.
- It is the simplest possible Neural Network.
- Neural Networks are the building blocks of Machine Learning.

**Popular types:** CNN, RNN, LSTM, GRU

## 1) Clustering

It is type of Unsupervised Learning.

**Clustering:** Categorizing similar data

### 1.1) Density Method

The Density Method considers points in a dense regions to have more similarities and differences than points in a lower dense region. The density method has a good accuracy. It also has the ability to merge clusters.

Two common algorithms are **DBSCAN** and **OPTICS**.

### 1.2) Hierarchical Method

The Hierarchical Method forms the clusters in a tree-type structure. New clusters are formed using previously formed clusters.

Two common algorithms are **CURE** and **BIRCH**.

### 1.3) Grid-based Method

The Grid-based Method formulates the data into a finite number of cells that form a grid-like structure.

Two common algorithms are **CLIQUE** and **STING**.

### 1.4) Partitioning Method

The Partitioning Method partitions the objects into k clusters and each partition forms one cluster.

One common algorithm is **CLARANS**.

**Corrolation**: The Correlation Coefficient (r) describes the strength and direction of a linear relationship and x/y variables on a scatterplot.

The value of r is always between -1 and +1:
